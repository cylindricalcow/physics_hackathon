# physics_hackathon
HackIllinois 2018 project by UIUC physics students with various coding backgrounds. Our project was to create a Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) inspired AR mobile game with realtime geocoding. We broke into multiple subgroups that worked on the server, game engine, user interface (UI), transcribing D&D open source information into databases, mapping api, and art & design. 

We successfully created a Rasberry Pi server implemented with Twisted that contained comprehensive databases, interactive map of campus, rudimentary UI that can be ported to Android, IOS, Windows, and Linux , a distributed game engine with combat and character specific features.
